# MkDocs Variable Randomizer Plugin

Basically the idea is to use random variable names in code snippets.
This can for example be used to make code snippets that are [harder to fingerprint](https://github.com/t3l3machus/PowerShell-Obfuscation-Bible?tab=readme-ov-file#rename-objects), thus useful for offensive code like AMSI bypasses.
